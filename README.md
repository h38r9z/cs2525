Expectations: 
SEE   BELOW
Specific instructions: 
You   have been   provided with   a research paper   on   a virology topic, for which you   have to write   a   News    Views Article.To   help with this assignment, you should   read the   paper, try to   understand the   area   and   impact.      You   will then attend a session   (in the   timetable)   where   we   will   discuss   the   paper,   and   be   given   some   help   with what the   purpose of a   News  Views article   is,   and   what   makes   a   good   New    Views   article.
General Information on News and Views Articles:
News   and   Views   articles    (as   they    are    called    in   the    Nature    Journals)   are   found    in    many    scientific   journals.    In other journals they are often called   commentaries.      It   is   important for jour代 写LIFE 320 Virus Disease Mechanism 2023/24C/C++
代做程序编程语言nals to   provide   its   readers   with   a   broad   and   accessible   overview   of   the   most   important   and   interesting   advances   in   the   scientific   area   covered   by the journal.    A   News    Views   article   is   specifically   designed   to   achieve   this   goal,   by   informing   readers via   short   commentaries   about   interesting   advances   in the   area   in the   latest   published   papers.News   and   Views   articles   are   always   short   (i.e.   focused),   around   1,000   words   in   length.   The   central   message   of the   News   and   Views   must   be   stated   clearly   in   the   first   paragraph,   then   put   in   context   of   what   the   paper   shows   (and   in   relation   to   other   work   in   this   area).      The   piece   should   be   written   in   a   manner accessible to non-specialists (but is not written in lay language).   Personal opinions, viewpoints   and   predictions   are   encouraged. The inclusion of one figure is mandatory to   illustrate   the   specific   points   made or the   more general context of the   research   results   reported.
So some questions to think about for this assignment: What   makes a good   News  Views article?
Why   is this   paper   interesting to   non-experts/specialists?   What question   (of general   interest) did   it address?
What does the   paper show   (and overall   message)?   Can you   link   it to other   published work?
The   News  Views Article should follow this format:
Title: The title   should   be   between   30   and 40   characters. Try to   use   ‘catchy’   keywords   in   the   title   and   be as clear   and   brief   as   possible.Lead: The   lead   is   an   important   part   of the   article. The   lead   appears   under   the   title   in   the   layout   of   a   News  Views   article to   help give   readers   a general   idea   of   what the   article   is   about.   The   lead   should   summarise the   key   area   of   research   and the   main   result   of the   article.       It   should   be   interesting   so to   make   readers   want to   read   more. Try to   use   keywords. This   should   be   between   20 to   30   words   (two   sentences generally or 3   short   ones).Main Text: The   main   message   of the   article   will   have   been   summed   up   in the   title   and   the   lead. The   rest of the text   (article) should expand on this   but   be as   clear   and   concise   as   possible. Try   to   use   short   sentences   and   break   paragraphs   up.   Think   about   using   one   paragraph   per   concept.   Each   paragraph   should   be   no   longer   than   250-300   words   maximum. The   first   paragraph   should   briefly   mention   the   paper   (the   subject   of   the   NVs)   –   the   background   and   key   message   i.e.   say   why   it   is   important   and   what (overall) it has found (and cite the paper   here). Then the   remaining text should focus on the data   (evidence/results)Figure: ONE figure   must   be   included.    It should not be an   image/figure   from   the   paper.      It   should   be   a   pictorial   image   to   represent   the   total   story   [this   could   be   called   a   graphical   abstract,   some journals   include   these   for   primary   research   articles]. This figure should be generated by you (i.e.   an   original   figure).References: I   would   expect   around   5   or   6    references,    no    more   than    10.       The    actual    paper    being   discussed   should   only   be   referenced   once   or twice   at   most –   once   at the very   beginning   and   perhaps   again when you start to   review the data   (after the general   introduction).
